        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello everyone, allow me to introduce myself, I am Leslie Garcia. I am 18 years old and I am a first year, pre-business student at the University of California-Riverside. I am originally from Los Angeles but I am currently living in Riverside due to school. I am a first generation college student and I am very proud of being Mexican-American. My parents are originally from Toluca, Mexico therefore, I am fluent in both Spanish and English.<br><br>

        Some of my hobbies are listening to music, shopping and hanging out with my friends. I would like to consider myself a very family oriented person, my family is the most important thing in my life, along with my friends. A quote that has resonated with me is by American author and activist, Helen Keller which states ‚ÄúDo not think of today‚Äôs failures, but of the success that may come tomorrow‚Äù. <br><br>

        Although I am currently a pre-business student, hopefully in the near future I would like to major in either Administration or Marketing. Growing up, most of my family and friends had their own businesses, and having previous work experience in small businesses as well, I was inspired to major in business. I have actually worked at two different restaurants. My first job was at a restaurant called ‚ÄúSugarbox LA‚Äù, I was a crepe maker and cashier. I worked there for about one year, before moving on to my next job. My second and current job is at a restaurant called ‚ÄúTamales Lilianas‚Äù. I work in the front register as a cashier and waitress. I have been working at this restaurant for a little over a year. By far this has been my favorite job and working in customer service has taught me so much. It has taught me about customer service, more specifically how to interact and speak to a customer. Seeing a glimpse of what it is like and what it takes to run a business grew my interest, in both administration and marketing. Although I like my current job, I would like to have some experience working in an office setting and just learn more about my major and what it consists of.
